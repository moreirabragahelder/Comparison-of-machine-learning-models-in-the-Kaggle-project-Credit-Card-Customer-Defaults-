üìã Project Description This project implements a comprehensive comparative analysis between three classic Machine Learning algorithms for binary classification problems:  Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
Complete Machine Learning Models Analysis
A comprehensive Python framework for comparing and analyzing machine learning models with detailed visualizations and performance metrics.

Quick Start
Basic Usage
# Import and run the complete analysis
from ml_models_analysis import main

# Execute the full pipeline
results, comparison_df = main()

Using Your Own Data
# Load your data
X, y = load_and_prepare_data(file_path="your_data.csv", use_synthetic=False)

# The target column should be named 'default.payment.next.month'
# Or modify the code to match your target column name

Custom Model Configuration
# Modify hyperparameter grids in the train_models function
models = {
    'Logistic Regression': {
        'model': LogisticRegression(random_state=42, max_iter=1000),
        'params': {
            'classifier__C': [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10],  # Add more values
            'classifier__penalty': ['l1', 'l2', 'elasticnet'],  # Add elasticnet
            # ... customize parameters
        }
    }
}

Performance Considerations
Memory Usage: Large datasets may require chunking or sampling
Training Time: Grid search can be time-intensive; consider RandomizedSearchCV for large parameter spaces
Cross-validation: Default is 5-fold CV; adjust based on dataset size
Best Practices
Data Quality: Ensure clean, balanced datasets for optimal results
Feature Engineering: Consider domain-specific feature transformations
Model Selection: Use cross-validation scores for model selection, not just test set performance
Hyperparameter Tuning: Start with coarse grids, then refine around optimal values
Evaluation: Consider multiple metrics; AUC for imbalanced datasets, F1-score for balanced datasets
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
ImportError for sklearn modules
pip install --upgrade scikit-learn

Memory errors with large datasets
# Reduce dataset size or use sampling
X_sample, y_sample = X.sample(n=10000), y.sample(n=10000)

Slow training times
# Reduce parameter grid size or use RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
